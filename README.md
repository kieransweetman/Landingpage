# Landing page: The Odin Project

Learning Elements:
  - CSS flexbox fundamentals 
  - Emmet
  - HTML Fundamentals (attributes and tags)
  - NavBar
  - Psuedo Classes


# Overview

For this small project, I was tasked to make a landing page based on a screenshot. I learned how to maniuplate flexbox's, apply CSS properties, and the positioning of all the important elements on the page. 

 

  - Getting the NavBar to stick, and to give it more 'depth' on the page (no nav tag) => used the 'position: fixed;' property with a box shadow. Items within are spaced evenly to give a more balanced look.
  
  - Adding onhover effets before learning JS => Having no JS knowledge at this stage, I learned more about pseudoclasses like ':active' and ':hover' to apply animation-like effects to my buttons and links on the page.
